    <h1>GROOMRS LLC PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="container terms-info" style="padding-bottom: 60px">
    <p><b>Effective date: Feb 1st 2019</b>
      <br>
      Our company GROOMRS LLC knows that you care about your personal information, how is used and how is shared
      but let us reassure you that we take your privacy seriously. Protecting and offering a transparent Privacy is
      essential to earn your Trust. Please read this document to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By using or
      accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this
      Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following
      ways.
      Remember that your use of GROOMRS LLC's Services is always subject to GROOMRS LLC's Terms which
      incorporates this Privacy Policy.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>Coverage</b>
      </br>
      This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we
      collect when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don't own or
      control, or people that we don't manage. We collect various types of Personal Information from our users and we
      use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and
      improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to
      contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services.
      In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.
      We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13,
      please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we
      learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as
      quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please
      contact us at support@thegroomersllc.com
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>Change to our Privacy Policy</b>
      </br>
      At The Groomer LLC we are constantly improving our Services, as a result of that we may need to change this
      Privacy Policy from time to time, however we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the
      www.thegroomersllc.com, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you've opted not
      to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven't provided us with your email address), those legal notices
      will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If
      you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all the
      changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such
      information is collected.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>Information Collected</b>
      <br>
      <i>Information You Provide to Us:</i>
      <br>
      We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process
      and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone
      number, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third
      party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services
      through a third-party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts ("Third
      Party Account Information") may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and
      that Third-Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. Certain
      information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.
      We may communicate with you if you've provided us the means to do so. For example, if you've given us your email
      address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of
      the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make
      our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive
      communications from us, please indicate your preference by clicking the unsubscribe links in our emails.
      </br>
      </br>
      <i>Information Collected Automatically</i>
      <br>
      Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from
      your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, "cookie"
      information, the type of browser and/or device you're using to access our Services, and the page or feature you
      requested. "Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your
      browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people.
      You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device's acceptance
      of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
      Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear
      on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also
      transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and
      we aren't responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third
      parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third
      parties may not honor "Do Not Track" requests you have set using your browser or device.
      We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We
      may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular
      feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as
      possible.
      </br>
      </br>
      <i>Google Analytics</i>
      <br>
      We use Google Analytics to help analyze how our users' use the Service. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect
      information such as how often our users visit the Service, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used
      prior to coming to the Service. We may use the information we get from Google Analytics to improve our Service or
      to send you promotional messages about our Services. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on
      the date you visit the Service, but not your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine
      the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with any personally identifying information.
      Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the
      next time you visit the Service, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and
      share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Service is restricted by the Google
      Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You may find additional information about Google Analytics
      at <span style="color: blue;">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</span>. Finally, you can opt out of
      Google Analytics by using the following
      add-on: <span style="color: blue;">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</span>.
      <br>
      <i>Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</i>

      </br>
      </br>
      Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after
      you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve
      the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your
      browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web
      applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to
      track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do
      Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while
      you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>Policy for Sharing Personal Information</b>
      <br>
      <b>Information that's been de-identified.</b> We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not
      identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage
      information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such
      information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you
      with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a
      partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual
      person.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>Advertisers:</b> We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners ("Advertisers") to choose the demographic
      information
      of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the
      information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that
      Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. We might allow Advertisers
      to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to
      Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Note that if an
      advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the
      advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.
      </br>
      </br>
      We may deliver a file to you through the Services (known as a "web beacon") from an ad network. Web beacons allow
      ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web
      beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because
      your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network's servers, these companies
      can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. You may be
      able to opt-out of web beacon tracking conducted by third parties through our Services by adjusting the Do Not
      Track settings on your browser; please note that we don't control whether or how these third parties comply with
      Do Not Track requests.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>Affiliated Businesses:</b> In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we're affiliated with may
      sell
      or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with
      us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will
      share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such
      transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party
      Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to
      your third party account. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or
      businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating
      to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business' or websites' policies.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>Agents:</b> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your
      information
      with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment processing GROOMRS LLC
      to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not
      have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Note
      that an "agent" may also be considered a "partner" in certain circumstances, and would be subject to the terms of
      the <b>"Information that's been de-identified"</b> section in that regard.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>User Profiles and Submissions:</b> Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any
      video or
      image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user
      interaction within the Services or address your request for our services. Your account privacy settings may allow
      you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in
      your user profile is visible to others. Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile,
      along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can
      view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected
      and used by anyone. Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments
      or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments.
      Additionally, if you sign into the Services through a third party social networking site or service, your list of
      "friends" from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Services, and such "friends," if they
      are also registered users of the Services, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered
      in your Services user profile. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site
      or service.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>Business Transfers:</b> We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer
      information in
      connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or
      if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information
      could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>Protection of GROOMRS LLC and Others:</b> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose
      any
      information that we [reasonably] believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our
      Terms and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of GROOMRS LLC, our employees, our
      users, or others.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>Personal Information protection and security</b>
      <br>
      Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third
      party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or
      service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and
      protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or
      device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
      <br>
      <br>
      We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but
      unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure,
      and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>Personal Information accessibility</b>
      <br>
      Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the information you've provided
      to us
      <br>
      The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change. If you have any questions
      about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at <span style="color: blue;">support@thegroomersllc.com</span>
      You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register
      with us or to take advantage of some of our features.
      <br>
      You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. When you update information, however,
      we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You may request deletion of your account by
      contacting support@thegroomersll.com and asking us to delete your account. Some information may remain in our
      records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or
      incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify
      you personally.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Contact Us</b>
      <br>
      If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to
