      purpose of making that Public User Submission accessible to all TGI users and providing the Services
      necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User

      communication sent by first class mail or pre-paid post to your address on record in TGI's account
      information. Such notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the expiration of 48 hours after
      sending. User may give notice to TGI (such notice shall be deemed given when received by TGI) by
      sending an electronic mail message to TGI at: <span style="color: rgb(228, 2, 2)">abcd@thegrooners.com</span>.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>ASSIGNMENT</b> - These Terms may not be assigned by user without the prior written approval of TGI but
      may be assigned at any time by TGI to: a parent or subsidiary an acquirer of assets a successor by
      merger, any purported assignment in violation of this section shall be void.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>TERM AND TERMINATION OF TERMS</b> - These Terms are effective upon user’s access or use of the
      Services. User or TGI may terminate participation in the Services at any time, for any reason and TGI may
      prohibit user’s use of the Services at any time in its sole discretion. These Terms, and any subsequent
      modification of these Terms, shall remain in effect at all times after user or TGI terminate participation
      or access to the Services.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>DISPUTES/MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION</b> - Any dispute or claim relating in any way to user’s
      use of the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, rather than in court,
      except that user may assert claims in small claims court if user’s claims qualify.
      ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS
      ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal
      arbitration law apply to this agreement. “Disputes” or “claims” under this provision shall include, but are
      not limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events,
      arising out of or relating to: the Terms and prior versions thereof (including the breach, termination,
      enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof), the Services, any other goods or services made
      available through the Services, user relationship with TGI, the threatened or actual suspension,
      deactivation or termination of user account with TGI, payments made by user or any payments made or
      allegedly owed to user, any promotions or offers made by TGI, any claims for fraud, defamation,
      emotional distress, breach of any express or implied contract or covenant, claims arising under federal
      or state consumer protection laws; claims arising under antitrust laws, claims arising under the
      Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act; and claims arising under the Uniform
      Trade Secrets Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans With Disabilities Act, and state statutes, if any,
      addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other federal and state statutory and common
      law claims. All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope,
      applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the
      arbitrator, except as expressly provided below. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review
      of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same
      damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and
      must follow these Terms as a court would. To begin an arbitration proceeding, user must send a letter
      requesting arbitration and describing user’s claim to TGI registered agent <span style="color: rgb(228, 2, 2)">Jose
        Negron at jnegron@thegroomers.com</span>. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its rules, including
      the
      JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards. JAMS’s rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-
      800-352-5267. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS
      rules. TGI will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $1,000 unless the arbitrator determines
      the claims are frivolous. Likewise, TGI will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the
      arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. User may choose to have the arbitration conducted by
      telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where user lives or at another
      mutually agreed location. USER AND TGI EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS
      WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR
      REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any claim or
      issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to
      consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on a class, collective, or representative basis. Other than
      disputes regarding the validity of the class action waiver contained herein, which disputes may be
      resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction, all disputes regarding the scope and validity of
      these Terms will be resolved by the arbitrator. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in
      arbitration user and TGI each waive any right to a jury trial. User and TGI also both agree that user or TGI
      may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. CHOICE OF
      LAW Except as provided above in the DISPUTES/MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION section, these
      Terms will be governed by the laws of Florida without regard to choice of law principles. This choice of
      law provision is only intended to specify the use of Florida law to interpret this Agreement and does not
      create any other substantive right to non-Floridians to assert claims under Florida law whether by
      statute, common law, or otherwise. GENERAL No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency
      relationship exists between you, TGI or any third party provider as a result of these Terms or use of the
      Services. If any provision of the Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be
      struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent under law. The failure of TGI
      to enforce any right or provision in these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision
      unless acknowledged and agreed to by TGI in writing. These Terms comprise the entire agreement
      between user and TGI and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or terms,
      whether written or oral, between the parties regarding the subject matter contained herein. If any
      provision of these Terms is or becomes invalid or non-binding, the parties shall remain bound by all
      other provisions hereof. In that event, the parties will replace the invalid or non- binding provision with
      provisions that are valid and binding and that have, to the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as
      the invalid or non-binding provision, given the contents and purpose of these Terms. THIRD PARTY
      APPLICATIONS The Services may be available or accessed in connection with TGI applications
      (“Applications”) made available by third party providers such as Apple, Inc., or Google, Inc. (“Provider”)
      through their storefronts such as the App Store and Google Play. Both user and TGI acknowledge that
      the Terms are concluded between user and TGI only, and not with any Provider, and that a Provider is
      not responsible for the TGI Services; The Application is licensed to user on a limited, non-exclusive,
      nontransferrable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for user’s
      private, personal, non-commercial use, subject to all the terms and conditions of these Terms as they
      are applicable to the Services; User will only use the Application in connection with a Provider’s device
      that user own or controls; user acknowledges and agrees that a Provider has no obligation whatsoever
      to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application; In the event of any
      failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, user
      may notify the Provider of such failure; upon notification, the Provider’s sole warranty obligation to user
      will be to refund to user the purchase price, if any, of the Application; You acknowledge and agree that
      TGI, and not the Provider, is responsible for addressing any claims user or any third party may have in
      relation to the Application; User acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of any third party claim that
      the Application or user’s possession and use of the Application infringes that third party's intellectual
      property rights, TGI, and not the Provider, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement
      and discharge of any such infringement claim; User represents and warrants that user is not located in a
      country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as
      a "terrorist supporting" country, and that user is not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or
      restricted parties; Both user and TGI acknowledge and agree that, in user’s use of the Application, user
      will comply with any applicable third party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such
      use; and Both user and TGI acknowledge and agree that the Provider and its subsidiaries are third party
      beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon user’s acceptance of these Terms, the Provider will have the
      right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against user as the third
      party beneficiary hereof. In the event the user uses the Application to provide user with real-time route
      guidance, USER’S USE OF THIS REAL TIME ROUTE GUIDANCE APPLICATION IS AT USER’S SOLE RISK.
      LOCATION DATA MAY NOT BE ACCURATE.
