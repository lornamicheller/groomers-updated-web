      <br>
      <br>
      <b>PET OWNER OBLIGATIONS</b> - Pet owners warrant and agree that: (1) your pets are free from fleas, ticks, and
      other
      pests; and (2) you will have your pets fully vaccinated and up to date on all forms of preventative medicine
      prior to receiving services from a Pet Care Provider.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>PAYMENT TERMS</b> - You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services you
      receive
      from a Pet Care Provider. After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Services,
      Groomrs will facilitate your payment of the applicable charges on behalf of the Pet Care Provider, as such
      Pet Care Provider's limited payment collection agent. Payment of such charges in such manner shall be considered
      the same as payment made directly by you to the Pet Care Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes
      where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Groomrs.
      You shall not request lower charges from a Pet Care Provider for services received by you from such
      Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods. Groomrs will not respond to any request
      from a Pet Care Provider to modify charges for a particular service. Pet Care Provider will be to independently
      establish its own charges for the execution of services agreed thru Groomrs services. All charges are due
      immediately and payment will be facilitated by Groomrs using the preferred payment method designated in your
      Groomrs account, after which Groomrs will send you a receipt by email. If your primary payment method is
      determined to be expired,
      invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Groomrs may, as the Pet Care Provider's limited
      payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your account, if available. As between you and
      Groomrs, Groomrs reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise charges for any or all services
      obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Groomrs’s sole discretion. Groomrs will use
      reasonable efforts to inform you of charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for charges
      incurred under your Groomrs account regardless of your awareness of such charges or the amounts thereof. Groomrs
      may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in
      different amounts charged for the same or similar services obtained through the use of the Services, and you
      agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on
      your use of the Services or the charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services from a
      Pet Care Provider at any time prior to such Pet Care Provider's arrival, in which case you may be charged a
      cancellation fee. This payment structure is not intended to compensate the Pet Care Provider for the services
      provided. Groomrs does not designate any portion of your payment as a
      tip or gratuity to the Pet Care Provider. Any representation by Groomrs to the effect that tipping is
      "voluntary," "not required," and/or "included" in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not
      intended to suggest that Groomrs provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Pet
      Care Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to
      any Pet Care Provider who provides you with services obtained through the Services, you are under no obligation
      to do so. Gratuities are voluntary directly to the Pet Care Provider. After you have received services or goods
      obtained through the Services, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional
      feedback about your Pet Care Provider.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>CONSENT TO AUTODIALED TEXT MESSAGES AND PHONE CALLS</b> - You agree that Groomrs may contact you by
      autodialed
      text messages and phone calls with information about the Services, your account, and with marketing messages,
      even if your phone number is on a do-not-call list. You are not required to provide this consent as a condition
      of purchasing anything or using the Services, and may opt out at any time by contacting customer care at (561)
      990-6612. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you agree to promptly update your
      Groomrs account information to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person that acquires your old
      number.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>CONSENT TO CALL RECORDING</b> - You agree that any phone calls to or from Groomrs may be monitored or
      recorded
      for quality assurance purposes.
      </br>
      </br>
      <b>CONSENT TO PET CARE PROVIDER PHOTO AND VIDEO ACTIVITIES</b> - You understand and agree that certain Pet Care
      Providers may take pictures, videos, and other forms of recorded media of your pet during the course of providing
      Services to you. You further understand and agree that Pet Care Providers may post, upload, share, store, or
      otherwise provide any such pictures, videos, or other forms of recorded media to Groomrs through the
      Services. You understand and agree that such recorded media may be used not only to provide information to you as
      part of the Services, but also to assist Groomrs in quality control, safety, and promotional and marketing
      activities. You agree that you have no right, title, or other ownership interest to or in such pictures, videos,
      or other forms of recorded media, and that the use of such media, including the posting or display of such media,

      the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the
      sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do
      so. If you share a User Submission only in a manner that only certain specified users can view (for example, a

      that more than just you or certain specified users can view (a "Public User Submission"), then you grant Groomes
      the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission
      for the purpose of making that Public User Submission accessible to all Groomrs users and providing the Services
      necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User
      Submission in connection with the Services for any purpose. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a

      prohibit your use of the Services at any time in its sole discretion. These Terms, and any subsequent

      <br>
      <br>
      <b>DISPUTES/MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION</b> - Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the
      Services
      will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, rather than in court, except that you may assert
      claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. <b>ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN
        INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED</b>. The Federal Arbitration Act and
      federal
      arbitration law apply to this agreement. “Disputes” or “claims” under this provision shall include, but are not
      limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events, arising out of
      or relating to: the Terms and prior versions thereof (including the breach, termination, enforcement,
      interpretation or validity thereof), the Services, any other goods or services made available through the
      Services, your relationship with Groomrs, the threatened or actual suspension, deactivation or termination
      of your account with Groomrs, payments made by you or any payments made or allegedly owed to you, any promotions
      or offers made by Groomrs, any claims for fraud, defamation, emotional distress, breach of any express or
      implied contract or covenant, claims arising under federal or state consumer protection laws; claims arising
      under antitrust laws, claims arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act;
      and claims arising under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans With Disabilities
      Act, and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other federal and state
      statutory and common law claims. All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about
      the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided
      by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review
      of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and
      relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms
      as a court would. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and
      describing your claim to our registered agent Jose O. Negron at <span style="color: blue;">@thegroomersllc.com</span>.
      The arbitration will be
      conducted by JAMS under its rules, including the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards. JAMS’s rules are available at
      <span style="color: blue;">www.jamsadr.com</span> or by calling 1-800-352-5267. Payment of all filing,
      administration and arbitrator
      fees will be
      governed by the JAMS rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the
      arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Groomrs will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in
      arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration
      conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another
      mutually agreed location. <b>WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN
        INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION</b>. The arbitrator shall have no
      authority to consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis. The
      arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on a class, collective,
      or representative basis. Other than disputes regarding the validity of the class action waiver contained herein,
      which disputes may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction, all disputes regarding the scope
      and validity of these Terms will be resolved by the arbitrator. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court
      rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring
      suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights. <b>CHOICE OF LAW</b> Except
      as
      provided above in the <b>DISPUTES/MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION</b> section, these Terms will be governed by
      the laws
      of California without regard to choice of law principles. This choice of law provision is only intended to
      specify the use of Caifornia law to interpret this Agreement and does not create any other substantive right to
      non-Californians to assert claims under California law whether by statute, common law, or otherwise. GENERAL No
      joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you, Groomrs or any third
      party provider as a result of these Terms or use of the Services. If any provision of the Terms is held to be
      invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the
      fullest extent under law. The failure of Groomrs to enforce any right or provision in these Terms shall not
      constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by Groomrs in writing.
      These Terms comprise the entire agreement between you and Groomrs and supersedes all prior or
      contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or terms, whether written or oral, between the parties regarding the
      subject matter contained herein. If any provision of these Terms is or becomes invalid or non-binding, the
      parties shall remain bound by all other provisions hereof. In that event, the parties will replace the invalid or
      non- binding provision with provisions that are valid and binding and that have, to the greatest extent possible,
      a similar effect as the invalid or non-binding provision, given the contents and purpose of these Terms.
